My name is Brad Cushion, I am 33 years old and live in Swindon.
I currently work for Wiltshire Police as a Detention Officer, however I am in the process of completing several AWS certifications with a view to a career change!
The more I learn about the world of AWS and coding the more fascinated I become with it. In order to supplement my AWS learning, I thought it would be a good idea to supplement my learning with extra-curricular things, such as learning Python and HTML, which has bought me here!
My wife has recently started up a new business as a mobile dog groomer, I thought it would be a fun project to create a website for her business... It's going to be a surprise for Christmas though, so keep it a secret!
